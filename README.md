# Explaining anaphoric accessibility: navigating non-veridical environments in dynamic semantics

- **Area:** Language and Logic (LaLo).
- **Level:** Advanced.
- **Lecturers:** Patrick Elliott and Lisa Hofmann.

## Class description

Classical dynamic accounts of anaphora rely on logical operators arbitrarily manipulating anaphoric information. Alongside conceptual concerns of explanatory (in)adequacy, classical accounts are known to make poor empirical predictions for non-veridical environments (see, e.g., Roberts 1987, Krahmer and Muskens 1995). In this course, we motivate an alternative approach, which treats logical operators as fundamentally truth-functional. In the first half of the course, we explore an approach to anaphora based on the Strong Kleene account of presupposition projection. The initial goal will be to derive and improve upon Groenendijk & Stokhof's (1991) accessibility generalizations, with a particular focus on negation and disjunction. The latter half of the course zooms in on counterfactual content: The initial Strong Kleene account fails to capture key constraints on the (anti)veridicality of anaphorically active content. We revise the account by intensionalizing discourse referents, which are in turn interpreted relative to both a local and a global intensional context.
